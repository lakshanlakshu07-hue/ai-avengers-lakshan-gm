# 🚗 Smart Parking: Revolutionizing Urban Mobility 🌍

## 📌 Overview
With rapid urbanization and the growing number of vehicles, cities around the world face **traffic congestion**, **parking shortages**, and **environmental pollution**. Traditional parking systems are inefficient, time-consuming, and often frustrating for drivers.

💡 **Smart Parking Systems** introduce intelligent, technology-driven solutions using **IoT**, **AI**, **Cloud Computing**, and **Mobile Applications** to optimize parking operations and transform urban mobility into a smarter, greener, and more efficient experience.

## 🤔 What Is Smart Parking?
Smart Parking is an advanced parking management solution that uses **real-time data** to monitor and manage parking spaces efficiently.

🔹 Sensors detect whether a parking space is occupied  
🔹 Data is sent to a central system  
🔹 Drivers are guided to available spaces instantly  

This minimizes traffic, saves time, and improves overall city movement 🚦
